 *  Singleton. Autopilot, logic and HAL all use this and communicate through this as the program is integral.
 *  Should be easy to replace with another implementation for FIFO files, virtual filesystem, etc as the AP and stuff become a separate programs.
 *
 *
 *  I don't really mind if it's not singleton but a static collection of methods. Global variables are evil no matter how does one call them.
